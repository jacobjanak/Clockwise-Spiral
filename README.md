# Clockwise Spiral

This is my solution to a coding challenge I found online. The challenge is to take in a positive integer (n) and return an n by n grid of numbers starting at 1 that spirals clockwise as the numbers increase until it ends with n^2 in the middle.

For example, the number 3 should return:
```
1 2 3
8 9 4
7 6 5
```
To run this file, type into your command line:

`node server.js 3` (3 can be any positive integer)
